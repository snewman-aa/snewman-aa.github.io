> "Sam is able to think deeply about problems and build solutions that align to organizational priorities and constraints. He is a strong coder, has a sound understanding of the AI and engineering technologies he uses, and has an uncanny ability to communicate clearly at any level of technical detail. On top of all this, Sam is generous, empathic, and genuine — an absolute joy to work with."
