Hear what colleagues and leaders have to say about my work.

> "Sam is able to think deeply about problems and build solutions that align to organizational priorities and constraints. He is a strong coder, has a sound understanding of the AI and engineering technologies he uses, and has an uncanny ability to communicate clearly at any level of technical detail. On top of all this, Sam is generous, empathic, and genuine — an absolute joy to work with."

> "There are few people that understand what it means to take accountability for their work, and that's what Sam brings to the table. Not only does he have the technical and theoretical skills to carry out end to end ML projects, but he puts in the extra work to make sure that everyone is on the same page by communicating actively to make it happen. Having him on your team brings the sense of calm that only comes from having a dependable colleague."

> **— Fiona Dixon, 2025**

> "Sam works skillfully with multiple stakeholders to build a solid understanding of each application of AI that can be built and evaluated with technical rigor, surfacing the multifaceted challenges of bias and ethics, assuring that our technologies deliver on their purpose. This "technical rigor" is no mean feat: task definition is the start, but Sam can take a project through the identification of data sources and the writing of annotation guidelines. Even though no one stakeholder (other than I, as his manager) can truly appreciate the importance of every dimension of his work, Sam maintains congenial relationships with all involved."
